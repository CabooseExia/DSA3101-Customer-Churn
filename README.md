# DSA3101 Customer Churn
## Introduction
Welcome to our DSA3101 Project: **GXSmartChurn**

In this full-stack development project, we integrate machine learning predictive models to analyze diverse customer data, enabling accurate identification of customers at risk of discontinuing bank services. Additionally, our unique rule-based customer segmentation enhances our predictive modeling, offering a holistic and targeted perspective for the bank to adopt effective retention strategies. Moreover, our project extends beyond backend models, incorporating intuitive UI design to enhance user experience. Through visualizations, stakeholders can quickly derive insights from our predictions and segmentation, facilitating informed decision-making.
